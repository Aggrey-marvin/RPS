1.computerPlay function:
  We shall have an array containing rock, paper and scissors.
  We shall use a random function to randomly choose the array index that is needed
  we shall have a string variable that will be assigned the value at the random array index chosen


2.round function(Will have a parameter of the value chosen by the computer)
  Prompt the user to enter a choice, rock, paper, or scissors and store the value in a variable.
  Convert all the letters to lowercase and assign  them to a new variable.
  Assuming the variable are "player" and "computer"
  if(player = rock && computer = rock) print = It's a draw
  else if(player = rock && computer = paper) print = You lose, paper beats rock
  else if(player = rock && computer = scissors) print = You win, rock beats scissors
  else if(player = paper && computer = rock) print = You win, paper beats rock
  else if(player = paper && computer = paper) print = It's a draw
  else if(player = paper && computer = scissors) print = You lose, scissors beat rock
  else if(player = scissors && computer = rock) print = You lose, rock beats scissors
  else if(player = scissors && computer = paper) print = You win, scissors beat paper
  else print = It's a draw

 3.game function
  It will have a for loop that runs five times.
  The for loop should record each time the person playing wins in a variable.
  That value should be incremented in every loop if the person wins.
  The function should return the value.

 4.final stage
  Test whether the value returned by the function is >= 3
  if(value >= 3) print = Congratulations, you win.
  else print = Sorry, you lose, better luck next time.
